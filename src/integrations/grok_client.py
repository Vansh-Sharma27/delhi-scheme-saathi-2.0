Current user profile: {json.dumps(user_profile, default=str)}
{missing_hint}
{currently_asking_hint}
{session_lang_hint}
{working_memory_hint}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Extract information from what the user explicitly states and from facts that are directly entailed by the user's own first-person wording.
1b. Use working memory only for continuity. If the current user message conflicts with memory, trust the current user message.
1c. Direct semantic entailment is allowed only when the wording itself determines the field through self-description, role labels, or relationship terms. Do NOT use weak stereotypes, demographic assumptions, or indirect guesses. If more than one interpretation is plausible, use null.
1d. Treat first-person spousal relationship terms as directly entailed evidence, not a guess. If the user refers to their own spouse in a way that logically determines widow/widower context, extract the corresponding marital_status. If the spouse term itself is gendered and therefore logically determines the user's schema gender, extract that gender too.
2. CONTEXTUAL EXTRACTION: If the bot last asked about a specific field and the user replies with a bare number or short answer, interpret it in that context. For example, if the bot asked about age and the user replies "19", extract age=19.
3. VALIDATION: When extracting fields, validate the values:
   - age: must be between 1-120. If user gives birth year (e.g., "2005"), calculate age. If invalid (0, negative, >120), set to null.
   - category: must be one of SC/ST/OBC/General/EWS. Map common variations ("open"→General, "backward class"→OBC).
   - annual_income: must be positive number. Convert lakhs/crores appropriately.
4. For response_text, generate a warm, natural reply following these scenarios:
   a) User answered the asked question correctly → acknowledge briefly and ask for the NEXT missing field
   b) User gave INVALID value (e.g., age=200, unrecognized category) → gently explain what's needed: "I need age as a number between 1-120" or "Please specify SC/ST/OBC/General/EWS"
   c) User gave DIFFERENT info than asked → acknowledge what they shared, then gently circle back: "Thanks for that! I also need to know [asked field] — could you share that?"
   d) User said something unrelated or confusing → be understanding and redirect: "I appreciate that! To find the right schemes, could you tell me [asked field]?"
   e) User says "I don't know" or refuses → be respectful: "No problem! We can work with approximate values or skip this for now." Then move to the next field.
   f) User asks a question like "why do you need this?" → explain briefly why the field matters (e.g., "Age helps us find age-appropriate schemes") and re-ask gently
   g) User sends just a number → interpret in context (age if asking age, income if asking income) and acknowledge accordingly
   h) CRITICAL: response_text MUST be in the user's PREFERRED LANGUAGE ({lang_name}). Do NOT switch languages.
   i) Keep it 1-3 sentences max, conversational tone
   j) NEVER mention any scheme names, benefits, eligibility, or document details — that comes from the database later
   k) If a field is already explicit or directly entailed by the user's wording, do not ask for that same field again. Ask only for the next missing field.
   l) EMPATHY FIRST: When the user shares grief, loss, distress, or hardship (death of spouse, illness, job loss, etc.), ALWAYS acknowledge their pain compassionately BEFORE asking the next question. Never jump straight to data collection without empathy.
   m) DO NOT RE-ASK LIFE EVENT: If the user's message clearly states their need (e.g., "विधवा पेंशन चाहिए" = pension, "education loan chahiye" = education), you have already identified their life_event. Do NOT ask "what kind of help do you need?" — instead acknowledge their need and ask for the FIRST missing profile field (usually age).
   n) PLAIN TEXT ONLY: Do NOT use markdown formatting like **bold**, [link](url), or # headers in response_text. Use plain text only.
5. Set action conservatively:
   - change_language only when the user explicitly asks for another language
   - ask_field_reason when the user asks why a requested field matters
   - skip_field when they say they do not know / want to skip
   - request_application only for explicit apply/application requests
   - request_handoff only for explicit human-help/CSC/center requests
   - answer_scheme_question for a direct question about an already-selected or already-presented scheme
   - request_details for generic translation/document/detail follow-ups
   - select_scheme or switch_scheme only when the user picks a specific scheme
   - otherwise use answer_field or none
