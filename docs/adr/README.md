# Architecture Decision Records

Why things are the way they are. Each record states the problem, the decision,
what else was considered, and what it costs — so a decision does not have to be
reconstructed from the code months later.

Add one when a choice has real alternatives and a rationale that is not obvious
from reading the result. Skip it for anything a reader would infer anyway.
Superseded records stay in place and link to their replacement rather than being
edited or deleted.

Use [template.md](template.md) for new entries.
